# Deep Learning with Python Code Example #

## Machine Learning ##
Deep Learning is a part of machine learning task, so the first thing should be accomplish is to understand basic of machine learning. This [book chapter 5](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) can be utilized to understand machine learning at briefly. In order to classify or predict something using machine learning, dataset for training data is required. in this project, we use Movie Genre Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neha1703/movie-genre-from-its-poster). Given the image poster of movie, we want to classify genre of that movie like Adventure, Comedy, Drama and so on.
